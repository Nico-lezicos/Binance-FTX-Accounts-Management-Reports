# Exchanges Accounts-Management-Reports

Ultimate Free Notebooks to Manage your money in Binance "Spot & Earn Flexible" or FTX Accounts

Someone has to deal with it so I did it, now you can't ask "WERE IS MY MONEY?" anymore. ðŸ“Š
* I developped it to work on Windows & Linux (ubuntu) platform.
* I choose Jupyter format on Python as it's a standard platform regarding data-science. It's allowing to generate Markdown files wich ay be a good report format.

Last update : 
  02/10/2022:
  - I have added "Exchanges Account Management" to accumulate exchanges datas in a new document
  - Pandas on Jupyter on Linux: pandas get a problem on this platform with sum() function, you just have to remove: "numeric_only=True", wich is  required on other platform

Some sample of what you'll get as a start
